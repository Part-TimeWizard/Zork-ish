# Zork-ish
Zork-ish is a text based adventure game based on the InfoCom classic, Zork.
I created it as a project for a high-school programming class.
In this game, you type in commands and the computer will interpret and carry 
out those actions, and will print out the result.

# How to Play

To play, simply type in commands as though you were talking to the computer,
like “Pick up key” or “go north” or even “Attack the scary monster with the
magic sword.” (don't worry, there are no scary monsters in this game...
or are there?) The computer will be able to interpret these phrases into
actions and act accordingly.

To ensure that you are understood, always start your sentences with a verb,
and always refer to an object.


Zork-ish assumes that everything in a room can be reached without having to
move around a room. As such, specifying to the computer to move somewhere is
only for moving between rooms. To move, simply specify which direction
you want to go. When referring to movement, always use the cardinal directions 
(north, south, east, and west). Think of it almost like a coordinate grid. You 
also move by just typing the direction or the first letter of the direction, 
such as “north” or “n” to go north.

By typing “i” or “inv”, you can view your inventory.
